 * Generics are required to write type safety code and to remove the risk of ClassCastException at run time.
 * Generics are introduced in Java 5 to provide the type checking at compile time.
 * If you use generics, you need not to perform the type casting explicitly.
 * Java compiler applies strong type checking if you use generics in your code and shows errors if the code violates the type safety.
  Thus removing the risk of ClassCastException.

  * Generics work only with derived types
